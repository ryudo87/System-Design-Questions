At NY they work mainly on Geo platform.
map-reduce concept to solve a big-data problem.

1) Find the single number in a array, all other elements are paired. 2) Give a array A[k], define the set S{k} := { A[k], A[A[k]], A[A[A[k]]], ... }, write program to count the maximum size of Sks.


Perform level-order traversal of an incomplete binary tree, i.e. certain nodes at a level could be empty.  

Selecting and removing elements from an HTML document seemed surprisingly straightforward--did the interviewer really just want me to call, for example, `jQuery('.class').remove()`? 

What does the 'ls' command do at system level when we type it. How is the directory and files maintained in a file system  

Merge 2 streams of integers and implement a getnextInt function. idea is like merge sort



design a max stack using one stack, what are the language features that are missing in your favorite language, tree to a ordered doubly linked list  




Determine if a binary search tree is valid or not.

The hardest question I was hit with was to write a function that takes an integer N and returns an NxN matrix with incrementing integers in a spiral, from outside in. 


finding the top k items in unsorted array. Finding overlap intervals.

in-order iterative binary search tree traversal.

 The interviewer asked me to implement a trie and write a 'getWithPrefix' function with a wildcard letter '*' 

2) Phone screen with the hiring manager Questions --What is the most challenging part of product management? --Give an example of a hunch you had and how you tested or quantified it. --How do you decide what experiments to run and balance between intuition and measurement?

topology sort

given a vector of strings of length n with each word having a length of m on average, group all anagrams into a cluster. Do this for the case that n >>>>>> m and in the most efficient way possible. Assume extra space allowed.

Find left sibling of a given node in a tree 

The first interview involved adding two large integers represented as strings together. In addition there were some questions about what jsonp is and performance of some JS code in the browser that manipulated the DOM.

The second interview involved listing out all the possible combinations of a phone number where each number can be represented by letters, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C]. The followup to that question involved the scenario where the number<->letter mapping involved numbers with more than one digit, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C], 2 = [D|E|F], 12=[X|Y|Z].

After that It was an onsite interview with ~6 people (2 hiring managers) with one team. I was asked to implement isHappy() where you return false if a number whose digits squared don't add up to 1, true otherwise. I was asked to write the merge() portion of a mergesort. I was asked JS-specific questions, specifically the context of "this", closures, implementing bind(). I was asked to implement the DOM selector portion of jQuery. Debugging an issue with some JS code (knowledge about JS and using the browser's debugger).  I was asked to come on site a second time to talk to another team with just 2-3 people. I was asked to listi all RHN numbers (defined as a scenario where there's a pair of unique numbers whose cube add up to the same number). Finding the longest palindrom of a string. Returning the k most frequent words in a string delimited by space.

1) Related to signal handling and process/threads 2) Relating to string parsing and pointer handling 3) some basic info on IP address, subnet masks


Given a number, tell how many '1's are there in the binary fomat of this number

find the subtree with maximum number of files given a filesystem tree. The interviewer clarified that directories need not be counted as a file. The interviewer also gave system call APIs (that he had made up) that should be used to access the filesystem.
