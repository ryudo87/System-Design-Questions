# AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform 
AWS Lambda was designed for use cases such as 
image or object uploads to Amazon S3, 
updates to DynamoDB tables, 
responding to website clicks 
AWS Lambda can also be used to automatically **provision back-end services** triggered by custom HTTP requests, 
and "spin down" such services when not in use, to save resources. 
These custom HTTP requests are configured in AWS API Gateway, 
which can also handle authentication and authorization in conjunction with **AWS Cognito**.

# Serverless Framework 
building applications exclusively on AWS Lambda
Serverless app can simply be a couple of lambda functions to accomplish some tasks, 
or an entire back-end composed of hundreds of lambda functions.
